Fraud Detection model based on anonymized credit card transactions.It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

As we have a classification problem on our hands we'll apply classification models and calculate the cross validation score to identify the best fit for our data.Some of the models that we are going to use are.

* Logistic Regression

* Support Vector Classifier

* Decision-Tree Classifier
